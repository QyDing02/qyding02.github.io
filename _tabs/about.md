## Short Biography
I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Information Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). 

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science and Technology, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU).

During my undergraduate studies, I was privileged to join the HCP lab at SYSU, under the guidance of Keze Wang, where I gained significant research experience.



## Research Interests
I'm interested in many areas and I'm always excited to take on something new. 

Recently, my research focuses on Computer Vision and Human-Computer Interaction. Most of my work now involves gesture generation based on diffusion models.

## Hobbies

I like to travel and take pictures. I enjoy the process of finding beauty in the world around me, and I'm glad to record it by my camera (M43) and my phone. I'm working on my photography skills with different lenses.

At the same time, I'm a transportation fanatic and am very interested in all types of transportation (spacecrafts, airplanes, trains, metros, etc.).
